*Backend notes*

**Chapter 1 - Backend Development**
Frontend - interface to make sending the requests easier.
    --User
    --Client (medium you use to access the website / application)
    --Front-end (the website - the interface)

Backend - process the network requests.
    --URL = address, the DNS translates the URL into the actual address which is the IP address in the network which corresponds to another device connected to the network.
    --Devices at IP address = servers connected to the internet to listen to incoming network requests and then send the response back.
    --Browswer receives the response from the server and displays it on the screen.
