#Learning git

Using VS code there's a view that lets me put a message in and hit commit. I want to learn how to do it without the helper because I think then I'll really understand.

##First notes

Git <> Github

##What is Git
It is a software that comes on your computer on Mac, Windows you have to download GitBash.

Git is a memory card for code.

If you have a project with a bunch of files - you want just like you have a video game you want to save your progress so if you die you don't lose all your progress.

Every so often you want to hit a command to save your progress.

##Do you need to know Git
Yes, it's one of the most basic things. You need to know Git, command line and then how to code

##To use Git you need a few commands
###Initialize folder or project with git
'git init' - this creates a repository - this is like putting a memory card into your gaming system

###How to save
'git add' - you can save everything or just a specific thing. Maybe you put a file name after 'git add' like 'git add index.html' or you can save everything with 'git add .'

95% of cases you'll just do 'git add .'

Technically this adds all files to the staging area

###Commit the changes to memory
'git commit -m '{describe the save}' the message lets you go back to the version you are saving. Example: 'git commit -m 'create new Git markdown'
